# Image-Recognition-System
Image Recognition System creates a deep learning model that learns from a image dataset-cifar10; This will classify a new image based on the learnings/knowledge of the model. In the second part, features are extracted from a pre-trained model. Based on the features a new model is created that learns and classify the image.
